<h2>üìùAbout</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The focus of the work at <a href="https://www.nitgoa.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Goa</a> is on Spoken Language Identification with a focus on development of Dialect Identification System. The task of spoken language identification (LID) involves automatically identifying the language in which a given speech utterance was spoken. An important aspect of a spoken language is its dialects. Dialects of a given language are differences in speaking style of the first language or native language (L1) because of geographical and ethnic differences.
</p>

<h2>Development of Dialect Identification System</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Dialect of a speech utterance acts as a virtual geo-tag for the utterance that helps in predicting the geographical location to which a speaker belongs. The dialectal variations of a spoken Indian language are a matter of concern for any automatic processing of speech utterances from that language. The project aims at addressing the issues of identifying the dialect in the conversational speech of the Indian languages. Dialect identification is difficult when compared to LID due to high interclass similarity among the dialects of a language. We also propose to explore deep learning methods for the dialect identification task.

<h1> Model Information </h1>

## Model weights

Model weights are saved as a pth file and present at [Marathi Model].(Model_Marathi.pth). 


## Model Architecture

We use [wav2vec2].(https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/wav2vec2) for feature extraction.
And use u-vector model as defined in <a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/specom/specom2023-2.html">Sean Monteiro, Ananya Angra, Muralikrishna H, Veena Thenkanidiyoor, and A. D. Dileep, Exploring the Impact of Different Approaches for Spoken Dialect Identification of Konkani Language, in Proceedings of 25th International Conference on Speech and Computer (SPECOM-2023), November-December 2023</a>

## Benchmark details

We use a variety of metrics as the benchmark for the validity of the model. Please see this document [Benchmark].() for more details.

<h1> Tutorials </h1>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can just visit the [NLTM_NIT_GOA](#) page for using this app.

### Prerequisites

There is no such complicated prerequisites for using this app except for `using modern browsers`. But if you are using it locally you will need `python3` and `nodejs>=16.0` and you will have to install some packages.

### ‚öôInstallation

If you want to get a local copy of this app.

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NLTM-NITG/DID.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder `NLTM_NIT_GOA`
    ```sh
    cd Dialect_Identification
    ```
3. To host the Backend, we need to install some packages via `pip`. Hence, run the following command. (Note: use `Python 3` only)

    ```sh
    # Installing backend dependencies
    pip install numpy pandas torch librosa ipython sklearn flask flask_cors
    ```
5. To host the website, there are three steps:
- **Step 1:** Begin by installing all necessary dependencies outlined in Step 3.
- **Step 2:** Proceed to install the required dependencies according to the specifications outlined in `requirements.txt`.
- **Step 3:** Initiate the server by executing the relevant command.

  
6. Run the following command to start the website with backend capabilities
    ```sh
    # Run the server
    python app.py
    ```

7. The site is hosted now on specified port as per Flask cnofig.

## Limitation
These models are trained are trained on a number of Indian Languages for a variety of dialects. Therefore, these models may fail in the following conditions.

- Presence of unfamiliar dialects and accents.
- Presence of high domain mismatch.
- Contains too much noise and unclear speech.
- Does not belong to the dialects of Puneri or Marawadi in Marathi Language.
- Note: Please follow the corresponding Readme.md file for more details.

## Fine tuning and inference pipeline

You can use the inference pipeline for wave2vec for feature extraction

Please download the model onto your local systeam. place the CSNET, LSTM and U-vec model code into your .py file.
Extract the features using wave2vece facebook model found here.
Pass feaatures through this model and use it.

For finetuning
Yet to add the script
